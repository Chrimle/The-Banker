        <blockquote>
            <em>
                After a total societal crash caused by AI, trust in technology is non-existent. Electronics have been
                abandoned and mostly outlawed, leaving people to rely on analog methods for communication, work,
                everything
                else. Communities are tight-knit and local, with trades, agreements, and daily life conducted
                face-to-face.
                Improvised human-operated mechanical devices are revitalizing past technologies - which are under heavy
                scrutiny by the various government bodies, conducting inspections for certifications and legal
                violations.
                Life is slower, and deliberate, as society struggles to rebuild a world where every action must be
                verified
                and nothing can be taken on faith in a system once dominated by Artificial Intelligence.
            </em>

            Since <em>The Disconnect</em>, You have been assigned your first job. As a bank teller at the first regional
            bank, you will play a crucial role in building trust in a new banking system and aid the community
            financially. Do this well, and all parties will benefit. But if you do not, you will be made an example,
            that is for sure...
